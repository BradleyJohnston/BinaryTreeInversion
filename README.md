# BinaryTreeInversion
I always heard about how inverting a binary tree is a common interview question and wasn't sure how to do that. At the time I thought that you would flip the tree horizontally (lets say you have a full 3 layer tree, I thought inverted would have 4 root nodes leading down to a singular leaf). I now understand the question is just flip it vertically and decided that was quite easy. Just a recursive traversal Going Left Right Visit. At each visit you just swap the left and right pointers using a temp variable. So just to make sure I understood correctly I made this, taking about 30 minutes. Don't particularly care to comment the code anymore than I did because this isn't even a project worth mentioning.
